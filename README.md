# Pulse

Pulse was a group project for my Software Development class. I provided the code which accesses the Reddit and YouTube API's and displays their respective results on the website. We have not maintained it, so it returns "no results" for each social media platform, however you can log in with the information below to see how the site worked when it was still functional, and my code is contained in this repository.

The webapp is hosted on Heroku and was built using Django. Copies of the 4 files to which I contributed the most are accessible from the main branch for convenience, but the master repository is accessible from this link:
